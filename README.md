# Monte Carlo Simulation of THF Polymerization  
A MATLAB program to simulate Janus polymerization of Tetrahydrofuran (THF), with *Monte Carlo* methods

## Prerequistes  
The program must runs with MATLAB R2014a(and any later versions) installed

## Install and Run
Download and git clone this repository into your local machine. Open the files in MATLAB, in command window, enter main(rate_ratio, feed_ratio,conversion) to run. You can choose any rate_ratio, feed_ratio and conversion, but recommended values are 1.6, 0.001, and 0.631.
